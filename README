I wrote this program to avoid the extreemly tedious process of hand creating
stripboards for use with fritzing.  Hopefully other people will find it 
useful as well.
 
It should be straight forward to build on most systems.  You need some version 
of Tcl installed and you need tcllib installed.  The program uses TclKits so 
it is not really dependent on the version of Tcl you have installed, but it 
does use tcllib and generaly tcllib won't install if Tcl itself is not 
installed.  It also uses Doxygen and LaTeX to generate the documentation.  Oh, 
it uses autotools and make (GnuMake) as part of the build process.

It is a purely command line program.  There is no GUI.  To generate a 
stripboard, you will need to write some (simple) Tcl.  On the one hand you can 
use loop structures to generate the bazillian holes.  On the other hand it 
probably means some actually programming and some knowledge of Tcl.  There is 
some "sample" code and I tried to document the API reasonably well, but please 
let me know if there anything that is not clear.
